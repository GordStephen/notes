% Photography from Physical First Principles

# Camera- and Lens-controlled Image Characteristics

- Field of view (angle)
- Depth of field (distance)
- Motion blur threshold (relative speed)
- Cleanliness (signal-to-noise ratio)
- Detail (perceived spatial resolution)

# Underlying physical properties of the image composition

- Subject distance
- Light intensity at lens (illuminance)

# Underlying physical properties/settings of the camera system

- Lens focal length (distance)
- Lens entrance pupil diameter/size (distance/area)
- Shutter speed (time)
- Capture area ratio
- Sensor resolution 
- Lens sharpness

# Intermediate properties

- Lens captured light (luminous flux) ~ lens entrance area x light intensity [lumens]
- Sensor captured light (?) ~ lens captured light x capture area ratio area x shutter speed [lumen seconds]
- Sensor captured light intensity (luminous exposure) ~ sensor captured light / sensor size [lux seconds]
